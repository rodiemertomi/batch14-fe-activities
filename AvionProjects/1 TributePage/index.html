                <p class="paragraph">Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born on Friday, May 29, 1970, in Manhattan, New York City, to Howard and Maria Stark. Stark had become good friends with 
                    Edwin Jarvis, the butler of the Stark family, who watched over him throughout all of his childhood. Stark's early life was often dominated by the absence 
                    of his father, who he would later describe as both 'cold' and 'calculating'. Growing up, Stark had issues with Howard, who never told his son that he loved, 
                    or even liked him. Since Stark was so young, Howard could not tell his son his plans for him. Howard constantly talked about his admiration for Captain America
                    which caused Stark to develop hatred and resentment towards the super soldier. However, Stark had a loving relationship with his mother, who was more gentle
                    and nurturing; he enjoyed hearing Maria play the piano.</p>
                 <p class="paragraph">At a young age, Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. When he was four years old, he designed his first circuit board. When he
                     was almost seven, he built a V8 motorbike engine. One thing about Stark's childhood that annoyed him was the nanny who cared for him until he was fourteen.
                     Stark attended Phillips Academy in Andover from 1977 to 1984. While, he was in high school, Stark hacked into the Pentagon on a dare by some friends.
                     He was admitted early into Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he met James Rhodes and they became lifelong best friends. At sixteen, Stark
                     won the 4th Annual MIT Robot Design Award. When he was seventeen, Stark graduated summa cum laude from MIT.
